# Remember: the name of the Class should ALWAYS be on singular.
# That's why the class will not be XMen, but XMan.

# Cool?

# From my perspective, every X-Men should have a name, a power, a gender and
# an age.

# Work on this file. If you want to work on IRB, you'll have to copy your code
# from here and paste there. And if you want to change the class there, you'll have to
# exit from IRB, open it again, and then paste the new version of it.

# Create the class with the initialize method.
# Create a method to introduce who's that X-Men by using it's instance
# variables inside it.

# And then, create instances of the X-Man class and print their presentations.
# So, execute this file and see the presentations getting printed on the terminal.

# After you have that working, google about Mystique of the X-Men.

# She can change her appearance, that's her power.
# So she could change her gender and her age, right?

# So, create the corresponding attribute readers and writers to allow that.

# And, finally, create the instance of the X-Man class to represent mystique.
# And change her instance variables, and print their new values.

# PS: An object is always an instance of some class.
# Previously, botafogo was an object. We can also say it was an instance of the
# FootballTeam class. :D
