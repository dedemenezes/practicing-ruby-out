# Now that we know the difference of printing and returning, I have a challenge
# for you.

x_men = ["Wolverine", "Jean Gray", "Professor X", "Magneto"]

# That is an array, as you know because of the [ ].

# Do not touch line 4.
# I want you to replace Magneto with Colossus.

# And then I want you to add a new x-men to our x_men array, it can be any x-men
# that you like.

# After that, I want you to loop over the x_men array and print
# "THE-NAME-OF-THE-SPECIFIC-X-MEN is really powerfull!"

# If you don't know how to loop over an array, don't be shy, just google
# "how to loop over an array in ruby" :)

# First, do that in IRB. After you have it working in IRB, change this file
# so we can execute it and see in the terminal the motivating phrase of every
# x-men of our x_men array.

# Remember: when running the file, it only shows in the terminal what you print
# (by using puts). When doing the same things in IRB, it prints everything that is
# returned.
