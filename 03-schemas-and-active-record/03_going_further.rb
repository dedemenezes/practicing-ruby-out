# HEY, you did it!
# You have:

# 1 ) Practiced on IRB
# 2 ) Executed ruby files
# 3 ) Played with arrays
# 4 ) Played with hashes
# 5 ) Had one more shot at OOP
# 6 ) Created a Class and instances of that Class
# 7 ) Studied at drawing schemas on db.lewagon.org
# 8 ) Wrote migrations
# 9 ) Created models
# 10 ) Played with ActiveRecord methods to create instances of
# the models (classes) you've designed

# If you feel this helped, and you want to practice more, I'd suggest you
# to do the following:

# 1 ) Create a new folder inside your code folder with the name playing-around
# 2 ) Create one new folder inside the one you just created with the name of the project
# you want to practice (Ex: pokemons, mcdonalds-meal-delivery, etc.)
# 3 ) Go inside it and run: git clone git@github.com:lewagon/active-record-boilerplate.git
# 4 ) Run: cd active-record-boilerplate
# 5 ) Run: bundle install
#
# And now you are with a sample project for playing with ActiveRecord.

# So draw the schema for that project, create the migrations, the models,
# build some seeds and then PLAY WITH THAT inside rake console

puts "Congrats! You can go back and re-do old exercises and/or livecodes as well if you want >:D"
